# Deblur-Project
Group project in Python realized for the Numerical-Computing course (University of Bologna), a.a. 2020/2021. The code implements several numerical methods capable of reconstructing an original image "X" from its corrupted version (which has additive Gaussian noise or Gaussian blur).

### Algorithms used: 
Gradient Descent Algorithm, Semi-Convergence Approach, Regularized Method (using norm-2, norm-1 and mixed-norm).

For details about the project: the pdf file contains the general specifications, a review of the numerical methods used, analysis of the results, a series of tests carried out on sample images (in italian only).
